				<!-- h4><a name="WhyClosureFX"></a>Why Closure FX Builder?</h4>
            <div class="margin"></div -->
				<h4>
					<a name="IsClosureFXFork"></a>Is Closure FX Builder a fork of
					Closure Compiler/Templates/Stylesheets?
				</h4>
				<div class="margin">No. Closure FX Builder is distributed
					including Google Closure Tools from the official repository and
					does not use or allow to use other forks.</div>
				<br />
				<h4>
					<a name="ClosureTools"></a>Why are Google Closure Tools included
					into Closure FX Builder?
				</h4>
				<div class="margin">The most important reason is simplifying
					installation and configuration processes for beginners.</div>
				<br />
				<h4>
					<a name="ClosureLibrary"></a>Does Closure FX Builder work with
					Closure Library?
				</h4>
				<div class="margin">Yes. Closure FX Builder allows you to
					compile JavaScript code used Closure Library easily and without
					additional tools or scripts.</div>
				<br />
				<h4>
					<a name="ClosureBased"></a>Is Closure FX Builder useful for
					compiling Closure-based code only?
				</h4>
				<div class="margin">
					No. Closure FX Builder uses <a
						href="https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/"
						target="_blank">Closure Compiler</a> and can be used to
					minify/compile/debug any JavaScript code (pure JavaScript, jQuery,
					Angular, Backbone etc.).
				</div>
				<!-- h4><a name="ClosureIDE"></a>What is the relation between Closure IDE and Closure FX Builder?</h4>
            <div class="margin">
            </div -->
				<br />
				<h4>
					<a name="ClosureFile"></a>What are .closure files?
				</h4>
				<div class="margin">
					<span class="italic">.closure</span> file is a configuration file
					which contains all needed information about the current build
					(sources, libraries, options etc.). It allows you to configure
					build process once, change it when you want and reuse it
					continuously. <br /> Moreover, you can create and use several <span
						class="italic">.closure</span> configuration files for one
					application.
				</div>
				<br />
				<h4>
					<a name="ClosureFXPlatforms"></a>What are System Requirements for
					Closure FX Builder?
				</h4>
				<div class="margin">Closure FX Builder is a cross-platform
					application and available for Windows, Unix and Mac OS. Closure FX
					Builder requires Java 7 or higher</div>
				<br />
				<h4>
					<a name="Java"></a>Where to download Java 7?
				</h4>
				<div class="margin">
					We recommend to <a
						href="http://java.com/en/download/help/index_installing.xml"
						target="_blank">download and use Oracle's distribution of Java
						7</a> from the official Oracle website.
				</div>
				<br />
				<h4>
					<a name="ClosureToolsSeparately"></a>Do I need to download Google
					Closure Tools separately?
				</h4>
				<div class="margin">
					Closure FX Builder already includes Closure Compiler, Closure
					Templates and Closure Stylesheets. <br /> Nevertheless, if you
					plan to use Closure Library in your project, you have to download
					it from <a
						href="https://code.google.com/p/closure-library/downloads/list"
						title="Closure Library" target="_blank">Closure Library
						repository</a>.
				</div>
				<br />
				<h4>
					<a name="Install"></a>Where can I find installation instructions?
				</h4>
				<div class="margin">
					Please explore <a
						href="http://digi-area.com/ClosureFX/getting-started.php"
						title="Closure FX Builder - Getting Started">Getting Started</a>

				<br />
				<h4>
					<a name="Newsgroup"></a>Is there a newsgroup or mailing list
					devoted to Closure FX Builder?
				</h4>
				<div class="margin">

						href="http://digi-area.com/subscription/"

				</div>
				<br />
				<h4>
					<a name="ReportBugInfo"></a> What information should I include in a
					bug report?
				</h4>
				<div class="margin">In addition to the comment describing the
					bug, you should specify the versions of Closure FX Builder, the
					Java platform and operating system you are using, because bugs
					often arise that are specific to particular versions. Sometimes the
					bug arises from the Java runtime environment or even the operating
					system, and knowing these details helps the developer team design
					testing and other debugging strategies.</div>
