/**
 * This interface provides for managing typed messages in a form. Typed messages
 * are messages associated with a type that indicates their severity (error,
 * warning, information). The interface is responsible for:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Bridging the concept of typed messages and control decorations</li>
 * <li>Adding one or more messages per control in a form</li>
 * <li>Rolling the local messages up to the form header</li>
 * <li>Adding one or more general messages to the form header</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * To use it in a form, do the following:
 * <ol>
 * <li>For each interactive control, add a listener to it to monitor user input</li>
 * <li>Every time the input changes, validate it. If there is a problem, add a
 * message with a unique key to the manager. If there is already a message with
 * the same key in the manager, its type and message text will be replaced (no
 * duplicates). Note that you add can messages with different keys to the same
 * control to track multiple problems with the user input.</li>
 * <li>If the problem has been cleared, remove the message using the key
 * (attempting to remove a message that is not in the manager is safe).</li>
 * <li>If something happens in the form that is not related to any control, use
 * the other <code>addMessage</code> method.</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * This interface should only be referenced. It must not be implemented or
 * extended.
 * </p>
 * 
 * @since 3.3
 * @see IMessageProvider
 * @see IManagedForm
 * @noimplement This interface is not intended to be implemented by clients.
 * @noextend This interface is not intended to be extended by clients.
